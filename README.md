## 🔒 Security Model

- **Scripts**: Version controlled on GitHub (no sensitive data)
- **Credentials**: Stored locally in `.env` file (gitignored, never committed)
- **Updates**: `git pull` to get script updates, credentials stay safe on your Mac
- **Flexibility**: Each Mac can have its own `.env` with unique credentials

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS Sonoma or later** (should work on earlier versions)
- **Airtable account** (free tier works great)
- **Homebrew** - Required for CPU temperature monitoring
- **Full Disk Access** (recommended) - For complete Time Machine backup detection

### 1. Install Homebrew and Dependencies

If you don't have Homebrew installed:

```bash
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install osx-cpu-temp (required for CPU temperature monitoring)
brew install osx-cpu-temp
```

### 2. Grant Full Disk Access (Recommended)

For optimal Time Machine backup detection, grant Full Disk Access:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Full Disk Access**
2. Click the **+** button
3. Add **Terminal** (`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`)
4. For automated monitoring, also add `/bin/bash`:
   - Click **+**, press **Cmd+Shift+G**
   - Type `/bin/bash` and click Go
   - Add it to the list
5. Toggle both **ON**

**Note:** The script works without Full Disk Access using filesystem-based backup detection, but FDA provides more reliable results.

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd ~/Documents  # or wherever you want to keep it
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/imac-health-monitor.git
cd imac-health-monitor
```

### 4. Set Up Airtable (5 minutes)

1. Go to [airtable.com](https://airtable.com) and sign in (or create free account)
2. Create a new base called **"iMac System Health"**
3. Rename the default table to **"System Health"**
4. Get your credentials:
   - **API Token**: Go to https://airtable.com/create/tokens
     - Create new token with scopes: `data.records:read`, `data.records:write`, `schema.bases:read`
     - Add your "iMac System Health" base to the token's access list
   - **Base ID**: Go to https://airtable.com/api, click your base, find the ID in the URL (starts with `app`)

### 5. Run Setup

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The interactive setup will:
- Create your local `.env` file with Airtable credentials (gitignored)
- Test your Airtable connection
- Run a test health check
- Configure automated scheduling (daily, twice daily, or every 6 hours)
- Load the launch agent for automatic execution

### 6. Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check your Airtable base for new health record
# View logs
tail -20 ~/Library/Logs/imac_health_monitor.log

# Verify scheduled job is loaded
launchctl list | grep healthmonitor
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Monitoring Schedule

Edit your launch agent:

```bash
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.imac.healthmonitor.plist
```

**Options:**

**Daily at 9 AM:**
```xml
<key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
<dict>
    <key>Hour</key>
    <integer>9</integer>
    <key>Minute</key>
    <integer>0</integer>
</dict>
```

**Twice daily (9 AM and 9 PM):**
```xml
<key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>9</integer>
    </dict>
    <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>21</integer>
    </dict>
</array>
```

**Every 6 hours:**
```xml
<key>StartInterval</key>
<integer>21600</integer>
```

After editing, reload:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.imac.healthmonitor.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.imac.healthmonitor.plist
```

### Update Airtable Credentials

```bash
nano .env  # Edit credentials directly
# Or re-run setup
./setup.sh
```

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Health Check Not Running Automatically

```bash
# Check if loaded
launchctl list | grep healthmonitor

# View error log
cat ~/Library/Logs/imac_health_monitor_stderr.log

# Reload launch agent
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.imac.healthmonitor.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.imac.healthmonitor.plist
```

### Time Machine Shows "No Backups Found"

The script has two methods for detecting Time Machine backups:

**Method 1: Full Disk Access (Recommended)**
- Grant Full Disk Access to Terminal and `/bin/bash` (see Quick Start step 2)
- This allows the script to use `tmutil latestbackup` for most reliable detection

**Method 2: Filesystem Access (Automatic Fallback)**
- If Full Disk Access is not granted, the script automatically falls back to filesystem-based detection
- Works by directly reading backup folder timestamps
- Requires Time Machine drive to be mounted when script runs

**If still showing no backups:**
1. Verify your Time Machine drive is mounted: `tmutil destinationinfo`
2. Check backup folders exist: `ls /Volumes/YOUR_TM_DRIVE/Backups.backupdb/`
3. Run manually to see detailed logs: `./imac_health_monitor.sh`

### CPU Temperature Shows "Unavailable"

```bash
# Check if osx-cpu-temp is installed
which osx-cpu-temp

# If not installed:
brew install osx-cpu-temp

# Test it:
osx-cpu-temp
```

### Data Not Appearing in Airtable

```bash
# Verify credentials
cat .env

# Test Airtable connection
./test_airtable_connection.sh

# Run manually to see errors
./imac_health_monitor.sh

# Check detailed logs
tail -100 ~/Library/Logs/imac_health_monitor.log
```

### Permission Errors

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x imac_health_monitor.sh setup.sh test_airtable_connection.sh
```

### After `git pull`, Something Broke

Your credentials are safe! Just reconfigure:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### What's Safe to Commit (and is in repo)
- ✅ All `.sh` scripts
- ✅ All `.md` documentation  
- ✅ `.env.example` (template only, no real credentials)
- ✅ `.gitignore` configuration

### What's Never Committed (gitignored)
- ❌ `.env` (your actual Airtable API credentials)
- ❌ `*.log` files (log output)
- ❌ `.DS_Store` (macOS system files)
- ❌ Any files with sensitive data

### If You Accidentally Commit Credentials

```bash
# Remove from repo but keep locally
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove .env from repository"
git push

# CRITICAL: Immediately rotate your Airtable API token
# Go to https://airtable.com/create/tokens and create new token
```
